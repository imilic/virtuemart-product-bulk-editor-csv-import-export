VM2/VM3 compatible

best VirtueMart bulk editing tool on the market! 

Must-have super simple utility component for VirtueMart online shops. It enables for user to change prices, stock and other product fields very easy and fast lake they do in MS Excel. UI and keyboard behavior is same as in MS Excel. User can also add new or delete products.
 
Average user needs around 45 min to modify price for 100 products using default VM interface (intense work). With this component needed time for same work task is around 6 min. From 1.0.12 we added support for product custom fields. Just imagine amount of time saving in case of editing them!
